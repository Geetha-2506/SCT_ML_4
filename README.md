Hand Gesture Recognition – SVM
This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Machine Learning Internship.

Objective:
Develop a model to recognize multiple hand gestures from image data.

Method
- Used LeapGestRecog dataset
- Loaded gesture images and preprocessed them
- Converted to grayscale, resized and flattened
- Trained SVM classifier for multi-class gesture recognition

Run: python task04_hand_gesture_recognition.py

Output: Gesture prediction results are saved in the outputs/ folder.
